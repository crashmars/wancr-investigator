This understanding goes back to the dawn of creation, when the primeval gods used the Words of Creation to speak the truename of the universe, thus bringing all things into existence. Everything—every plant, animal, stone, and building —possesses a truename which embodies its every property, and describes it in an unknowable language. To learn and speak these truenames is the oldest and most potent form of magic.</p>\n<p>Truename spells possess a different structure to other spells. First, you must learn a truename through a spell which allows you to discern the truename of an object, a creature, or a location. These spells can be cast as rituals, but have no inherent power on their own: you must utter the truename to gain power over its subject. Thus, it requires the casting of two spells to use truename magic. However, once you have a truename, you will generally remember it for 24 hours, allowing you to use several utterances upon the same subject.</p>\n<h1>Spell Lists</h1>\n<p>The following spell lists
